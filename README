SimpleC2CUDA
============

Generates host and device CUDA code from regular C programs.

To run, call:

$ python convert.py <FILE>.c

It generates <FILE>_host.hu, <FILE>_host.cu, containing code for the CUDA
device. Need to generate <FILE>_kernel.cu as well.


You can try out a.c, add.c and dead.c from tests/.
